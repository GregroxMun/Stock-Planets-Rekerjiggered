**Requires:**
* Kopernicus: https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus
* Kopernicus Expansions Regional PQSMods: https://github.com/StollD/KopernicusExpansion-Continued/releases

**Changelog**

* Sun: Changed to be a K0V main sequence star, representing its smaller mass and luminosity compared to a 1/10th scale stock sun. Its surface color and size have been changed to represent its new role.
* Eve: Heightmap replaced with the pre-0.21 version, reducing the size of the oceans. New atmosphere rims.
* Gilly: Made darker, given craters, and an ellipsoidal shape.
* Kerbin: Brighter scaledspace texture to match the pqs material shader. Reconfigured atmosphere rims, Kerbin now looks fantastic from a distance.
* Mun: Craters are flattened in the Munar Maria, and there is a crater with bright ejecta. (WIP)
* Minmus: Fixed orbit line color.
* Duna: A browner version of the Duna Restoration Project.
* Ike: New heightmap and terrain, more detailed and with craters. No longer just a noisy blob.
* Jool: Entirely new texture based upon the stock gradient. Bluer atmosphere color.
* Laythe: New atmosphere rims and dimmer atmosphere color. 
* Vall: Pale white color.
